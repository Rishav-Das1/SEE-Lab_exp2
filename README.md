# SEE-Lab_exp2
This is for the reference in the lab report. This repository consists of two codes which we wrote in the lab to conduct experiment on the SEE-Lab module.

If you don't have python installed in your pc then please just use the vertual invironment by typing in the terminal:

.\env\Scripts\activate

If it gives an error message saying that it is not working due to security reasons, then open powershell as administrator (assuming you are working on windows) and type the following:

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Then type y as it asks whether you are sure on not or something like that.

Now you can run the command ".\env\Scripts\activate" again and you would be taken to the vertual environment where python is already installed. Run your codes there as you run them on any terminal. Once you are done please exit the virtual environment using the 'exit' command.
